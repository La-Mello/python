'''
variable is a statically typed language hence no type during variable declaration
NOTE:{since no type is declared the variable can be reused }not good practise

'''
# declares an empty string
x="Hello world"
print(x)
print(type(x))

x=20
print(x)
print(type(x))

x=3.14
print(x)
print(type(x))

# boolean resolves to either true or false
isbool=True
print(isbool)
print(type(isbool))
